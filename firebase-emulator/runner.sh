# This script starts the local Firebase emulator with the configurations set
# via environment variables.
#
# The `RDB_EMULATOR_PORT` env configures the TCP port on which the Firebase Realtime DB emulator
# will be working on.
#
# The `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_PORT` env configures the TCP port on which the Firestore emulator
# will be working on.
#
# The `UI_EMULATOR_PORT` env configures the TCP port on which the emulators suite UI
# will be working on. The `UI_ENABLED` env allows disabling the emulators suite UI if set to
# any value other than `true`.
#
# The `AUTH_EMULATOR_PORT` env configures the TCP port on which the Firebase Authentication emulator
# will be working on.
#
# The `PUBSUB_EMULATOR_PORT` env configures the TCP port on which the Pub/Sub emulator
# will be working on.
#
# The `FUNCTIONS_EMULATOR_PORT` env configures the TCP port on which the Firebase Functions emulator
# will be working on.
#
# One may additionally configure the `EMULATORS_HOST` env variable to prevent running
# the emulator in the broadcast `0.0.0.0` mode.
